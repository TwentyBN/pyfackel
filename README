# pyfackel a meta package for pytorch

Installing pytorch is a little annoying: you have to go to the website, you
have to click your way through a couple of stupid questions and finally you get
to a long url that you submit to pip. Instead you can just
```
pip install pyfackel
```
and it will install pyfackel for you.
